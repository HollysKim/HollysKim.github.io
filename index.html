<h3>Project Abstract:</h3>
<p>
    Centered around transporation and urban planning, my project looks at NYC's motor vehicular collison accident statistics over the years in order to discover any plausible correlations and relationships between data variables such as boroughs, time of day and week, etc. In a city as populous and fast-paced as New York City, the data sets I'm using relating to motor vehicular collisions is massive in size. Thus, data science tools such as Pandas and SQL lend a significant helping hand in cleaning and filtering all the data collected over the years. By the end, I hope to uncover any plausible trends beneficial to fighting New York City's long-staying vehicular accident plague.
</p>
<h3>What I've done:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Cleaned and filtered through both data sets using Pandas and SQL.</li>
    <li>Discovered plausible correlations in the city's boroughs and injury statistics.</li>
    <li>Used matplotlib to visualize sample scatter-plot visualizations regarding the plausible correlations I found.</li>
    <li>Filtered the Motor Vehicle Collisions - Crashes data set by regular weekdays vs major holidays to look at niche time factors.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What I plan to do:</h3>
<ul2>
    <li>Find further plausible correlations between other data set variables, such as time of day, type of vehicle driven, etc.</li>
    <li>Create more visualization types such as pie charts and bar graphs.</li>
    <li>Utilize larger parts of the data sets, as my computer is unable to process them all at once.</li>
    <li>Possibly include other, small data sets to supplement and strenghten my research.</li>
</ul2>
